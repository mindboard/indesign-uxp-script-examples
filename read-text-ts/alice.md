# ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

## DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE

*Alice* was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "**and what is the use of a book,**" thought *Alice*, "**without pictures or conversations?**"

- *Alice*
- *White Rabbit*
- *Queen of Hearts*
- *King of Hearts*
- *Cheshire Cat*

*Alice* was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and *the White Rabbit* was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went *Alice* like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, "**Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!**" She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.
